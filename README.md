# Boiling Milk Detector
A WIP Machine Learning app using Tensorflow which will be able to tell if a pot of milk is boiling.
Used the CNN architecture of [nlintz](https://github.com/nlintz/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/05_convolutional_net.py).

## Requirements

1. Python 3.5
2. Tensorflow
3. OpenCV for python
4. numpy

## How to use

1. In the `preprocess` folder, run `ProcessVideos.py` > `WindowsToOneHot.py` > `Combine.py` in order.
2. Run `BasicCNN.py`
